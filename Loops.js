// Loops in javascript
// As it name suggests that loops are those things that helps us to do repetitive
// tasks in our code

// In javascript, at basic level we have 3 types of loops they are
// FOR - WHILE - DO WHILE

// FOR LOOPS:- if we exactly know that how many time we have to use that looping
//             than we will use for loops
//  |------------------------| -> initializing the loop
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i = i + 1) 
//      i = 1 -> start from 1
//      i <= 10 -> upto 10
//      i = i+1 -> add +1 every next time upto 10.
{
  console.log("sam "+i);
}
